# 🎮 Countdown Hub

Hey! Welcome to my custom countdown site for tracking upcoming events and releases!

## What This Site Does

This site keeps track of important dates like:
- 🎯 Game releases and events
- 🎄 Holidays and special occasions
- ⏱️ Any other date-based events I want to add!

## How to Use

**Just visit:** https://tomas6482.github.io/Countdown-site/

You can filter by category using the buttons at the top to see just the events you're interested in.

## Admin Stuff (Just For Me)

If you're seeing this and you're not me... nice try! 😜
The admin panel is password protected and only I can add new countdowns.

Have a date you want me to add? Just let me know and I can put it on the site!
